# read_group_size:
#   Form subgroups of model comm groups that read data together.
#   Each reader in the group only reads 1/read_group_size of the data
#   which is then all-gathered between the group.
#   This can reduce CPU memory usage as well as increase dataloader throughput.
#   The number of GPUs per model must be divisible by read_group_size.
#   To disable, set to 1.

# Default effective batch_size for training is 16
# For the o96 resolution, default per-gpu batch_size is 2 (8 gpus required)
# The global lr is calculated as:
# global_lr = local_lr * num_gpus_per_node * num_nodes / gpus_per_model
# Assuming a constant effective batch_size, any change in the per_gpu batch_size
# should come with a rescaling of the local_lr to keep a constant global_lr
